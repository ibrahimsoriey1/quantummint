# Security Protocols for Digital Money Generation System

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security protocols implemented in the Digital Money Generation System to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the platform. These protocols are designed to protect user data, financial transactions, and system operations from various threats and vulnerabilities.

  - Biometric authentication (where available)
- **Recovery Process**: Secure account recovery using pre-registered backup methods and identity verification

#### Password Policies
- Minimum 12 characters with complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- Password history enforcement (prevent reuse of last 5 passwords)
- Maximum password age of 90 days
